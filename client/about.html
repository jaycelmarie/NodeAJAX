            <h1 style="font-size: 50px;"> Application </h1>
            <p> Nana's Products allow users to Search, Add, Update and Delete products in the database. I used mongodb to store the JSON object of products and user information in the database.</p>
            <p> The server is running on localhost/8080 where the html file is sending a request to the server using HTTP modules</p>
            <p> The express server then gets the data from the database (mongodb) e.g products, users info. </p>
            <p> The server turns the data into a JSON response to send back to the client (HTML) and browser renders it in.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;"> Functionalities </h2>
            <h3 style="color: red;"> Search </h3>
            <p> Users can searche for a product by Name, Description or SKU number.</p>
            <p> If a match/s found, first 10 products are displayed. The user can then navigate through the products with arrows (pagination) </p>
            <p> If no product is found -> 'No product is found!' message.</p>
            <p> Alternatively, users can search for products according to price range.</p>
            <p> If a product is already searched, it filters it so include within searched products along the price range products.</p>

            <h3 style="color: red;"> Add Product </h3>
            <p> When adding a new product, the user is presented with a form to fill in the details. </p>
            <p> Validation: Checks if all fields are filled in, along with checking if SKU is an intenger/number format.</p>
            <p> Success: New Product Added Displayed.    -----    Failed: Error Message Displayed.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: red;"> Update Product </h3>
            <p> When updating a product, the user searches up the product name, if a product is found. The product details is show 
                to user and they are able to make changes. Once submitted, it checks if the SKU if integer/number before successful changes.
            </p>
            <p> Success: Product is updated Display Message.    -----    Failed: Error Message Displayed.</p>

            <h3 style="color: red;"> Delete Product </h3>
            <p> When deleting a product, a search bar is prompted to user to enter the product's SKU number. </p>
            <p> Success: Product is deleted Display Message.    -----    Failed: Error Message Displayed.</p>
            <p> *When searching for the deleted product, it will show as 'No Products Found!'</p>

            <h3 style="color: red;"> User Login/Logout </h3>
            <p> Users can login/logout. A pop up container renders in to prompt for user logins. Once authenticated and succesful, it logs in the user with a 'Welcome, -username-'.</p>
            <p> Users can log in using: username/email and password</p>
            <p> The server then checks if the user is logged in, if yes, it displays the 'Logout' button. the middleware checks if user is logged in. </p>
            <p> If user decides to log out, the server destroys the session.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: red;"> Registration </h3>
            <p> If user does not exist, they can register and the details get saved into the database. </p>
            <p> Even if session is destroyed, the successful registered users can maintain their account. </p>

            <h1 style="font-size: 50px;"> Weaknesses </h1>
            <p> The application cannot filter results of specific product within the price range. Instead, it searches up all products within that price range,
                along with the specific product searched by user.
            </p>
            <p> The user has to know the SKU in order to delete a product.</p>

            <h1 style="font-size: 50px;"> Future Work </h1>
            <p> - Due to time restriction, I was not able to add a 'Add to Cart' functionality. </p>
            <p> - I also would like to search products by category. </p>
